\chapter{Our findings}
Here we will write about what we were able to achieve with our fuzzer and describe different bugs found by our fuzzer.

\section{Authorization to increase coverage}
% - able to specify with cli args
% - more findings when auth token is provided (gitea/vault)
% - without token only auth is fuzzed since payload is usually not even parsed
